# loan_stattus_prediction
##the project was divided in 5 major steps--
1. In the first we have done the EDA with respect to the loan_status feature.

  a. in that we first removed the features dependents and loan_Id

  b. in second step we handled the null values with the help of mean and mode.

2. In the second step we have to encode the catagorical features and convert them into numerical values (0 and 1)
3. In the third step we chose randomizedsearchcv to find the best parameters for descision tree classifier and built the model and pickled the model
4. The fourth step was to  create app.py with the help of model to create app
5. The last step was for HTML files in which we moulded our frontend for the app and prediction layout.
